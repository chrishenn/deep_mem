# Deep Mem

An investigation into the space complexity of structured image data. We sought to understand explicit representations of images - as decomposed into local neighborhoods - and the data science requirements to process, store, and recall such representations.

Multiple methods and libraries were investigated to prototype storing and retreiving data in high-dimensional space.
